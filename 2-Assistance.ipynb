    "As said in the '1-Laboratory'-notebook the promoter strength is multiplied by the growth rate and the biomass concentration in order to determine the expression rate. The growth rate and the strength of the promoter can vary greatly depending, for example, on the growth temperature and on the nature of the promoter. The growth rate in turn has an influence on the maximum biomass that can be reached. Therefore, the expression rate as a function of growth rate and promoter strength will be shown below to better understand the influences on the final expression rate. The values refer to *P. putida*.       \n",
    "A total of three graphs can be seen. In one case the values of the promoter strength are in the same order of magnitude as the growth rate. In the other two graphs, the values are a little larger and a little smaller respectively.      \n",
