    "### RecExpSim\n",
    "RecExpSim is a simulation of selected steps in recombinant protein expression and the associated data analyses. The simulated experiments are strain characterization of growth parameters (optimal temperature, growth rate and maximum biomass), selection of promoter sequences, cloning steps, and evaluation of final expression strength.\n",
