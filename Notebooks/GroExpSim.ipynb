    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Biotechnology requires knowledge of microbial physiology and metabolism. Among the most important information is the growth rate and the substrate uptake rate. Both can be used to calculate the effectiveness of biotechnological production strategies and biomass and product yields. To identify an organism with suitable growth parameters, multiple strains, mutants or environmental conditions are tested which results in high throughput data. To analyse high throughput data computational approaches can speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different growth phenotypes: exponential, linear, saturated, diauxie. The typical microbial saturated growth is divided in different growth phases, lag, log, stationary, and death phase.\n",
