    "# Growth Experiment Analysis in Biotechnology\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Microbial growth dynamics play a pivotal role in industrial biotechnology, influencing various processes ranging from pharmaceutical production to wastewater treatment. Understanding the factors that govern microbial growth is crucial for optimizing biotechnological processes and harnessing the full potential of microorganisms. In this course, we delve into the significance of microbial growth in industrial biotechnology, elucidate the key factors influencing growth dynamics, and provide a concise overview of important growth laws used to characterize microbial growth patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microbial growth serves as the cornerstone of industrial biotechnology, facilitating the production of valuable compounds such as antibiotics, enzymes, biofuels, and organic acids. The ability of microorganisms to rapidly multiply under controlled conditions makes them indispensable for various biotechnological applications. By harnessing the metabolic capabilities of microorganisms, biotechnologists can efficiently convert renewable resources into high-value products, thus contributing to sustainable development and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors influence microbial growth dynamics, including environmental conditions, substrate availability, pH, temperature, and the presence of inhibitory compounds. The growth of microorganisms is highly sensitive to these factors, with each species exhibiting distinct growth characteristics under varying conditions. **Temperature, in particular, plays a crucial role** in determining the rate and extent of microbial growth, with each microorganism having an optimal growth temperature range. Additionally, the availability of nutrients and substrate concentration profoundly impacts microbial growth, with excess or limited nutrient availability leading to altered growth kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of industrial biotechnology, understanding microbial growth kinetics is imperative for process optimization and scale-up. Various growth laws and mathematical models have been developed to describe the growth dynamics of microorganisms under different conditions. Among these, the **exponential growth model, also known as the Malthusian growth model**, describes microbial growth as an exponential increase in cell number over time in a constant environment with abundant nutrients. However, in many real-world scenarios, microbial growth is constrained by factors such as limited nutrients or space, leading to logistic growth, which is described by the **logistic growth model, aka Verhulst equation**. This model accounts for a carrying capacity, representing the maximum population size that the environment can support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the **Monod equation** provides insights into substrate utilization kinetics by relating the specific growth rate of microorganisms to the substrate concentration. This model is particularly valuable in bioprocess engineering for predicting substrate uptake rates and optimizing fermentation conditions. Additionally, the Haldane equation extends the Monod equation by considering substrate inhibition, which occurs when high substrate concentrations inhibit microbial growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, microbial growth dynamics are fundamental to industrial biotechnology, driving processes that underpin the production of a myriad of valuable products. By elucidating the factors influencing growth and employing mathematical models to characterize growth kinetics, biotechnologists can optimize bioprocesses, enhance product yields, and foster innovation in the field of industrial biotechnology. Continued research in microbial growth dynamics holds the key to unlocking new avenues for sustainable production and addressing global challenges in healthcare, agriculture, and environmental conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running simulations\n",
    "The code cells below contain the commands to simulate the experiments. User input is required for variables that are by default set to `None`. Some simulated experiments cost money and the associated expenses are described in the respective text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final outcome of this sheet is an Excel file with simulated growth experiments containing biomass and substrate dynamics. The analysis of the Excel sheet to calculate growth rate, substrate uptake rate and yields is performed with the subsequent notebook [GroExpSim_Nr2](./GroExpSim_Nr2.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "The students achieve the following learning objectives based on [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).\n",
    "- List three growth laws. (Remember)\n",
    "- Explain why an exponential growth is ultimately unrealistic. (Understand)\n",
    "- Identify the correct growth law for a growth curve. (Apply)\n",
    "- Calculate growth rates from growth data. (Analyze)\n",
