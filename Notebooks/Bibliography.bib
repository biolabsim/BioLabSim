abstract = {In this age of technology, the vision of manufacturing industries built of smart factories is not a farfetched future. As a prerequisite for Industry 4.0, industrial sectors are moving towards digitalization and automation. Despite its tremendous growth reaching a sales value of worth {\$}188 billion in 2017, the biopharmaceutical sector distinctly lags in this transition. Currently, the challenges are innovative market disruptions such as personalized medicine as well as increasing commercial pressure for faster and cheaper product manufacturing. Improvements in digitalization and data analytics have been identified as key strategic activities for the next years to face these challenges. Alongside, there is an emphasis by the regulatory authorities on the use of advanced technologies, proclaimed through initiatives such as Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). In the manufacturing sector, the biopharmaceutical domain features some of the most complex and least understood processes. Thereby, process models that can transform process data into more valuable information, guide decision-making, and support the creation of digital and automated technologies are key enablers. This review summarizes the current state of model-based methods in different bioprocess related applications and presents the corresponding future vision for the biopharmaceutical industry to achieve the goals of Industry 4.0 while meeting the regulatory requirements.},

@article{Wehrs2020,
abstract = {While design and high-throughput build approaches in biotechnology have increasingly gained attention over the past decade, approaches to test strain performance in high-throughput have received less discussion in the literature. Here, we describe how fermentation characterization can be used to improve the overall efficiency of high-throughput DBTAL (design-build-test-analyze-learn) cycles in an industrial context. Fermentation characterization comprises an in-depth study of strain performance in a bioreactor setting and involves semi-frequent sampling and analytical measurement of substrates, cell densities and viabilities, and (by)products. We describe how fermentation characterization can be used to (1) improve (high-throughput) strain design approaches; (2) enable the development of bench-scale fermentation processes compatible with a wide diversity of strains; and (3) inform the development of high-throughput plate-based strain testing procedures for improved performance at larger scales.},

@article{Pinu2019,
abstract = {The use of multiple omics techniques (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) is becoming increasingly popular in all facets of life science. Omics techniques provide a more holistic molecular perspective of studied biological systems compared to traditional approaches. However, due to their inherent data differences, integrating multiple omics platforms remains an ongoing challenge for many researchers. As metabolites represent the downstream products of multiple interactions between genes, transcripts, and proteins, metabolomics, the tools and approaches routinely used in this field could assist with the integration of these complex multi-omics data sets. The question is, how? Here we provide some answers (in terms of methods, software tools and databases) along with a variety of recommendations and a list of continuing challenges as identified during a peer session on multi-omics integration that was held at the recent ‘Australian and New Zealand Metabolomics Conference' (ANZMET 2018) in Auckland, New Zealand (Sept. 2018). We envisage that this document will serve as a guide to metabolomics researchers and other members of the community wishing to perform multi-omics studies. We also believe that these ideas may allow the full promise of integrated multi-omics research and, ultimately, of systems biology to be realized.},

abstract = {Biosystems such as enzymes, pathways, and whole cells have been increasingly explored for biotechnological applications. However, the intricate connectivity and resulting complexity of biosystems poses a major hurdle in designing biosystems with desirable features. As -omics and other high throughput technologies have been rapidly developed, the promise of applying machine learning (ML) techniques in biosystems design has started to become a reality. ML models enable the identification of patterns within complicated biological data across multiple scales of analysis and can augment biosystems design applications by predicting new candidates for optimized performance. ML is being used at every stage of biosystems design to help find nonobvious engineering solutions with fewer design iterations. In this review, we first describe commonly used models and modeling paradigms within ML. We then discuss some applications of these models that have already shown success in biotechnological applications. Moreover, we discuss successful applications at all scales of biosystems design, including nucleic acids, genetic circuits, proteins, pathways, genomes, and bioprocesses. Finally, we discuss some limitations of these methods and potential solutions as well as prospects of the combination of ML and biosystems design.},

abstract = {Developments in biotechnology are increasingly dependent on the extensive use of big data, generated by modern high‐throughput instrumentation technologies, and stored in thousands of databases, public and private. Future developments in this area depend, critically, on the ability of biotechnology researchers to master the skills required to effectively integrate their own contributions with the large amounts of information available in these databases. This article offers a perspective of the relations that exist between the fields of big data and biotechnology, including the related technologies of artificial intelligence and machine learning and describes how data integration, data exploitation, and process optimization correspond to three essential steps in any future biotechnology project. The article also lists a number of application areas where the ability to use big data will become a key factor, including drug discovery, drug recycling, drug safety, functional and structural genomics, proteomics, pharmacogenetics, and pharmacogenomics, among others.},

abstract = {Research data management (RDM) requires standards, policies, and guidelines. Findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data management is critical for sustainable research. Therefore, collaborative approaches for managing FAIR-structured data are becoming increasingly important for long-term, sustainable RDM. However, they are rather hesitantly applied in bioengineering. One of the reasons may be found in the interdisciplinary character of the research field. In addition, bioengineering as application of principles of biology and tools of process engineering, often have to meet different criteria. In consequence, RDM is complicated by the fact that researchers from different scientific institutions must meet the criteria of their home institution, which can lead to additional conflicts. Therefore, centrally provided general repositories implementing a collaborative approach that enables data storage from the outset In a biotechnology research network with over 20 tandem projects, it was demonstrated how FAIR-RDM can be implemented through a collaborative approach and the use of a data structure. In addition, the importance of a structure within a repository was demonstrated to keep biotechnology research data available throughout the entire data lifecycle. Furthermore, the biotechnology research network highlighted the importance of a structure within a repository to keep research data available throughout the entire data lifecycle.
