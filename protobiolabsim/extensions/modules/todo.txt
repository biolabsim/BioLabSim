TODO:
Right now, three of the modules house all necessary operations for the RecExpSim lesson:
GenomeLibrary, GenomeExpression, GrowthBehaviour.

It works to make old code work on this new structure, but its more of an adaptation that does not
follow the essential structure.

The final version will have some differences:
    - Right now, only a library of Genes is implemented. In future, this should be extended with
    support for sequences.
    - Right now, promoter strength is also included here. In future, this should be an independent
    module with dependency to the GenomeLibrary.
    - Genome characteristics like "Optimal Primer Length" and " are also stored here. See where this
    should go.
