    "# Corona Vaccine Recombinant Expression Simulation\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Corona pandemic is paralyzing societies all over the world and people wait for vaccines to ease the situation. A number of vaccination strategies is based on protein subunits ([Jeyanathan et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-00434-6)), which are produced by bacterial recombinant expression ([He et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2016-0528), [Strizova et al.,2021](https://doi.org/10.1159/000514225)). You are member of a small biotech company, specialized in recombinant expression systems and your task is to develop a bacterial host to produce the highest possible amount of viral protein subunits. The expression of the viral protein is controlled by important sequences in the promoter and the final vaccine production rate depends on reaching a high biomass by cultivating in optimal temperatures. Alas, you have only a limited amount of money. You have to aquire the starting material equipment and each experiment costs resources.\n",

    "    <figcaption>The largest share of Corona vaccines use recombinantly expressed protein subunits (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-00434-6'>Jeyanathan et al., 2020</a>). </figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, selected steps of a biotechnological project for recombinant expressions are simulated. The experimental work in your biotech company is highly automated: you are setting the parameters of the experiments and focus on computational data analysis. The goal is to optimize the production rate of the protein subunits to be competitive compared to your peers. To achieve this goal, virtual experiments have to be performed to optimize growth conditions and promoter sequence for the production. Finally, a comparison will be performed how the GC-content of the promoter affects the promoter activity. The data analysis can be performed either separately with Excel, or with some guided coding steps within this script. \n",
    "\n",
    "You start with a budget of 10.000 EUR. The initial laboratory setup and each subsequent experiment is associated with an investment. To optimize your initial host-promoter combination towards more effective production, a number of 4-6 strains might be necessary. Initially, you decide on how much money to spend on the laboratory equipment, investing too little will result in a higher failure rate of experiments. Some steps are difficult to perform. The exact parameters for effective cloning are unknown and depend on various complex factors.\n",

    "## Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "This simulation is based on a Jupyter Python Notebook. You just have to work through it from top to bottom. The Notebooks are composed of a sequence of cells that can be either text, like this introduction, or python code cells to be run. Code cells have a grey background, and after execution the output is shown directly beneath. A blue stripe on the left edge of the screen marks the currently active cell. More information on how to use Jupyter Notebooks are [here](https://medium.com/edureka/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet-88f60d1aca7). In general, two input modes exist: \n",
    "* Command mode: evaluation of code, `Escape` or click outside cell activates Command mode\n",
    "* Edit mode: writing into cells, `Enter` or double-click inside cell activates Edit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating in Jupyter:\n",
    "*  activate cell above/below: `arrow up/down keys` in Command mode.     \n",
    "*  execute cell: `Ctrl + Enter` in Command mode.\n",
    "*  hide/show navigation panel on the left: click on folder symbol or `Ctrl + b`\n",
    "*  here **`None`** designates places for user input\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell can also be edited and executed multiple times. Next to the code cells in the upper left corner the status of the cell is displayed in square brackets. If you have not executed a cell yet, the brackets are empty. If the computer is currently executing the code, an small star appears there. If the cell has been executed, a number corresponding to the execution order of the cells is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information is important if you get stuck in the workflow or if you have changed the code to become dysfunctional. If the resources run out or you are unsatisfied with your choices, restart the kernel: click on Kernel in the top bar and select restart. All information on your strain and all you executions are resetted and you get a slightly different system, whose properties you have to find out again. If you have inserted your own code to the extend that the simulation is dysfunctional, or you have deleted original code accidentally and you wish to come back to the original state you have to delete the biolabsim folder. To do so, use the last cell in this notebook. You will have to shut down and reload the Jupyter Notebook instance as described in the last cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional workbook named *2-Assistance.ipynb* contains guidance for some of the experiments. You can open it by double-click on the name in the left navigation panel. Then the notebook will open in a new window like you know it from a browser. To switch back to the original notebook, just select the other tab again or close the new one with the 'x'.     \n",

You can perform the data analysis in Excel by importing the data file `Production_Experiments.csv` and generating a scatter plot of relative expression rate versus GC-content. Alternatively, you can use the Python code with scrambled lines (interactive web-site: [in this link](http://parsons.problemsolving.io/puzzle/7cd06ab7e8c94c7eba31bc50ac07a0a7)).\n",
