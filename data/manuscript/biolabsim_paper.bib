abstract = {Genome-scale network reconstructions are built from curated and systematized knowledge 1,2 that enables them to quantitatively describe genotype-phenotype relationships. Genome-scale models (GEMs) are mathematical representations of reconstructed networks that facilitate computation and prediction of multiscale phenotypes through the optimization of an objective function of interest 3,4. The development of a GEM requires curated metabolic knowledge bases, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 5 , and an annotated genome sequence of the organism of interest. By mapping the annotated genome sequence (Fig. 1a) to the knowledge base, one can reconstruct a metabolic network composed of all known metabolic reactions (Fig. 1b). This metabolic network can be converted into a mathematical format-a stoichiometric matrix (S matrix)-where the columns represent reactions, rows represent metabolites and each entry is the corresponding coefficient of a particular metabolite in a reaction (Fig. 1c). A cellular objective is needed to enable computation of a feasible metabolic flux that optimizes the model objective. A widely used objective function is to optimize growth rate, represented by a biomass function 6 , composed of essential metabolites needed for growth. The detailed steps to reconstruct a GEM have been described in a formal protocol 1. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is the most widely used 7 approach to characterize GEMs. GEMs can simulate metabolic flux states of the reconstructed network while incorporating multiple constraints to ensure the solution identified by FBA is physiologically relevant and compliant with governing constraints, such as the metabolic network topology represented by the S matrix, a steady-state assumption (that is, the internal metab olites must be produced and consumed in a flux-balanced manner), and other limits on nutrient uptake rates, enzyme capacities and protein/gene expression profiles. The S matrix and the objective function define a system of linear equations that can be solved given the imposed constraints, resulting in a solution space (that is, a space where all feasible phenotypic states exist) (Fig. 1d,e). FBA can identify a single optimal flux distribution or multiple optimal flux distributions that optimize the objective function in the solution space (Fig. 1f). FBA and many other GEM analysis methods are available through COBRApy 8 in Python or the COBRA Toolbox in MATLAB 9. GEMs have been successfully implemented for a wide range of applications 10-17 , including understanding microorganisms 16-22 , metabolic engineering 23-27,23-26,28 , drug development 29 , prediction of enzyme functions 30 , and understanding microbial community interactions 31-40 Python An interpreted, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in computational biology. Abstract | Escherichia coli is considered to be the best-known microorganism given the large number of published studies detailing its genes, its genome and the biochemical functions of its molecular components. This vast literature has been systematically assembled into a reconstruction of the biochemical reaction networks that underlie E. coli's functions, a process which is now being applied to an increasing number of microorganisms. Genome-scale reconstructed networks are organized and systematized knowledge bases that have multiple uses, including conversion into computational models that interpret and predict phenotypic states and the consequences of environmental and genetic perturbations. These genome-scale models (GEMs) now enable us to develop pan-genome analyses that provide mechanistic insights, detail the selection pressures on proteome allocation and address stress phenotypes. In this Review, we first discuss the overall development of GEMs and their applications. Next, we review the evolution of the most complete GEM that has been developed to date: the E. coli GEM. Finally, we explore three emerging areas in genome-scale modelling of microbial phenotypes: collections of strain-specific models, metabolic and macromolecular expression models, and simulation of stress responses.},

abstract = {Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genome sequencing and de novo assembly, once the exclusive domain of well-funded international consortia, have become increasingly affordable, thus fitting the budgets of individual research groups. Third-generation long-read DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly used, providing extensive genomic toolkits that were once reserved for a few select model organisms. Generating high-quality genome assemblies and annotations for many aquatic species still presents significant challenges due to their large genome sizes, complexity, and high chromosome numbers. Indeed, selecting the most appropriate sequencing and software platforms and annotation pipelines for a new genome project can be daunting because tools often only work in limited contexts. In genomics, generating a high-quality genome assembly/annotation has become an indispensable tool for better understanding the biology of any species. Herein, we state 12 steps to help researchers get started in genome projects by presenting guidelines that are broadly applicable (to any species), sustainable over time, and cover all aspects of genome assembly and annotation projects from start to finish. We review some commonly used approaches, including practical methods to extract high-quality DNA and choices for the best sequencing platforms and library preparations. In addition, we discuss the range of potential bioinformatics pipelines, including structural and functional annotations (e.g., transposable elements and repetitive sequences). This paper also includes information on how to build a wide community for a genome project, the importance of data management, and how to make the data and results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) by submitting them to a public repository and sharing them with the research community.},

This often results in difficulties during the design of validation experiments, which are usually labor-intensive, expensive to perform and hard to interpret.Results Here we propose PHENSIM, a systems biology approach, which can simulate the effects of activation/inhibition of one or multiple biomolecules on cell phenotypes by exploiting signaling pathways. Possible applications of our tool include prediction of the outcome of drug administration, knockdown experiments, gene transduction and exposure to exosomal cargo. Importantly, this method allows the user to make inferences on well-defined cell lines and includes pathway maps from three different model organisms. The basic assumption is that phenotypes can be described through changes in pathway activity. Results from our study show discrete prediction accuracy, highlighting the capabilities of this methodology.Availability and Implementation PHENSIM has been developed in Java and it is available, along with all data and source codes, at https://github.com/alaimos/phensim.

abstract = {Uncovering the general principles that govern the architecture of metabolic networks is key to understanding the emergence and evolution of living systems. Artificial chemistries, in silico representations of chemical reaction networks arising from a defined set of mathematical rules, can help address this challenge by enabling the exploration of alternative chemical universes and the possible metabolic networks that could emerge within them. Here we focus on artificial chemistries in which strings of characters represent simplified molecules, and string concatenation and splitting represent possible chemical reactions. We study string chemistries using tools borrowed from the field of stoichiometric constraint-based modeling of organismal metabolic networks, through a novel Python package, ARtificial CHemistry NEtwork Toolbox (ARCHNET). In addition to exploring the complexity and connectivity properties of different string chemistries, we developed a network-pruning algorithm that can generate minimal metabolic networks capable of producing a specified set of biomass precursors from a given assortment of environmental molecules within the string chemistry framework. We found that the identities of the metabolites in the biomass reaction wield much more influence over the structure of the minimal metabolic networks than the identities of the nutrient metabolites-a notion that could help us better understand the rise and evolution of biochemical organization. Our work provides a bridge between artificial chemistries and stoichiometric modeling, which can help address a broad range of open questions, from the spontaneous emergence of an organized metabolism to the structure of microbial communities. Introduction Metabolism occupies a central role in the functioning of biological systems, yet much remains unclear about the degree to which basic features of metabolic networks reflect evolutionary accidents or optimal network structures [1-4]. In parallel to analyses focused on metabolism as we know it in individual organisms [5,6] or in the whole biosphere [2,7,8], multiple studies have explored the utility of abstract models of chemistry to investigate particular features of chemical networks. These models, also known as artificial chemistries, have the benefit of being unconstrained by the limits of what is known about extant metabolism and about its possible intermediate states lost through evolutionary history [9-11]. Artificial chemistry has been used to study various aspects of the origin of life from abiotic chemistry [9,11,12], common structural features of metabolic networks (e.g. hub metabolites) [13-15], the general behavior of chemical (not necessarily biochemical) reaction networks [10,16], the optimality (or lack thereof) of metabolic networks [17,18], among other questions [9].

Various strategies exist to acquire MS/MS fragmentation spectra; however, the development of new acquisition strategies is hampered by the lack of simulators that let researchers prototype, compare, and optimize strategies before validations on real machines. We introduce Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS), a metabolomics LC-MS/MS simulator framework that allows for scan-level control of the MS2 acquisition process in silico. ViMMS can generate new LC-MS/MS data based on empirical data or virtually re-run a previous LC-MS/MS analysis using pre-existing data to allow the testing of different fragmentation strategies. To demonstrate its utility, we show how ViMMS can be used to optimize N for Top-N data-dependent acquisition (DDA) acquisition, giving results comparable to modifying N on the mass spectrometer. We expect that ViMMS will save method development time by allowing for offline evaluation of novel fragmentation strategies and optimization of the fragmentation strategy for a particular experiment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids.

AALTOLAB consists of an interactive, web-based 360° virtual laboratory, integrated with a Moodle-based digital exam with automatic assessment. The modular platform offers different modules from general comprehensive laboratory training to more specialised modules. Students and staff can freely navigate in the laboratory rooms at any time and interact with different action points including interactive videos, slideshows, and minigames. Our technical solution allows teachers even with limited technological skills to easily modify the training materials in real time. The relationship of students' learning experiences and level of learning is also discussed. We believe that our safety training concept facilitates deep learning and students' engagement, thus improving safety culture in our laboratories.},

abstract = {Building a virtual laboratory for teaching and learning is a highly complex process, incorporating diverse areas such as interaction design, visualisation, and pedagogy. This article focuses on the production and implementation issues that were found in the comparison of two different virtual laboratory projects, and discuss which design considerations can be drawn from these observations. Two web-based virtual laboratories - the Gas Laboratory and the Virtual Colour Laboratory - were developed independently of each other within two different content areas. The laboratories share considerable overlaps in goals and production circumstances. Through a comparison of production and outcome, similar problems related to design, development and implementation were observed. The research uses a mixed method approach combining quantitative pre- and post-tests for assessments, qualitative surveys, and qualitative, ethnographic observations and interviews. By comparing the background material, five design challenges for developing virtual laboratories are identified: 1) how to balance ambitions with available resources; 2) how to balance intended levels of user interaction with exploratory freedom; 3) how to find appropriate levels of realism depending on target group; 4) how to choose between mimicking real world appearance and enhanced features; and 5) how to find the best learning situation for the virtual laboratory. To meet these challenges, the following design considerations are proposed: Guide the design work with a clear understanding of purpose and context; select appropriate technology to ensure efficient design and media usage; select level of realism considering purpose and end users; and provide learning guides before and after the virtual lab session.},

abstract = {Simulation based learning has emerged as a new tool that potentially could replace and amplify the real-world experience in a fully interactive way. This learning technique can play a key role in the classroom setting to provide engineering students with the required knowledge and skills. In order to evaluate the possibility of using virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory as a tool in learning to mitigate practical dilemmas in chemical engineering curriculum, a virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory has been designed and developed at the University of Waikato. The virtual laboratory was made available to the third-year chemical engineering students enrolled in the biotechnology course. Participants were asked to attend both the physical and virtual laboratories and complete a range of questionnaires. It was found that by conducting the virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory, students gained a deeper understanding about fermentation principles, laboratory safety rules, experiment design and analysis of data. Based on the results, virtual reality bioprocess engineering laboratory can also provide a safe, affordable and timely experience to gain the required bioprocess engineering proficiency and skills. More than 90 {\%} of students found the virtual lab to be an essential tool to undertake hands-on experiments effectively.},

We introduced a Health and Safety virtual laboratory simulation to a core large first-year science module. Having surveyed students using a combination of Likert-type responses, multiple answer questions and free text responses, students reported that it had increased understanding and knowledge. Additionally, students reported that the laboratory simulation was motivating and had increased confidence for actual practical classes. We also surveyed students one year after completing the simulation finding a similar pattern of responses; the simulation had been useful, increasing confidence and knowledge about Health and Safety. Our data show that the virtual laboratory simulation improved student understanding and was still perceived to have been useful one year after completion, providing evidence of a longer term impact of the simulation on student learning.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language.

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The availability of tools that enable the precise modification of cells, as well as the ability to collect large amounts of multimodal data, open the possibility of sophisticated bioengineering to produce fuels, specialty and commodity chemicals, materials, and other renewable bioproducts. However, despite new tools and exponentially increasing data volumes, synthetic biology cannot yet fulfill its true potential due to our inability to predict the behavior of biological systems.

@article{Liebal2020,
abstract = {Strain engineering in biotechnology modifies metabolic pathways in microorganisms to overproduce target metabolites. To modify metabolic pathway activity in bacteria, gene expression is an effective and easy manipulated process, specifically the promoter sequence recognized by sigma factors. Promoter libraries are generated to scan the expression activity of different promoter sequences and to identify sequence positions that predict activity. To maximize information retrieval, a well-designed experimental setup is required. We present a computational workflow to analyse promoter libraries; by applying this workflow to seven libraries, we aim to identify critical design principles. The workflow is based on a Python Jupyter Notebook and covers the following steps: (i) statistical sequence analysis, (ii) sequence-input to expression-output predictions, (iii) estimator performance evaluation, and (iv) new sequence prediction with defined activity. The workflow can process multiple promoter libraries, across species or reporter proteins, and classify or regress expression activity. The strongest predictions in the sample libraries were achieved when the promoters in the library were recognized by a single sigma factor and a unique reporter system. A trade-off between sample size and sequence diversity reduces prediction quality, and we present a relationship to estimate the minimum sample size. The workflow guides the user through analysis and machine-learning training, is open source and easily adaptable to include alternative machine-learning strategies and to process sequence libraries from other expression-related problems. The workflow is a contribution to increase insight to the growing application of high-throughput experiments and provides support for efficient strain engineering. 2 1 Introduction Metabolic engineering aims at optimizing metabolite production by adjusting the activity of native and heterologous enzymes. A frequently manipulated factor of activity is the enzyme concentration which can be regulated on the transcriptional, translational and post-translational level. For each level, computational models were developed allowing realistic simulations and supporting rational adjustment. Models of  E transcription in E. coli were developed by Rhodius et al. (2010; 2012) and allow analysis of the effects of upstream regulating elements and core promoter. Translational components affect enzyme concentration via ribosome binding site, codon usage and mRNA stability. The effect of the ribosome binding site depends on the homology of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and mRNA secondary structures and for E. coli a predictive model was published (Salis et al., 2009) and recently integrated with a resource allocation model (N{\'{o}}bel and Pic{\'{o}}, 2020). The codon usage, mRNA stability and enzyme concentration are correlated and jointly determine enzyme concentration in E. coli (Kudla et al., 2009; Boel et al., 2016), and a predictive model of mRNA stability was published by Cetnar {\&} Salis (2020). Finally, protein stability determines concentration and a review of predictive models is given by Fang (2020). Although the models have reported high correlation between prediction and experiment, the massive evaluation of 244.000 sequences for translational effects during   expression in E. coli achieved lower correlation (Cambray et al., 2018). In conclusion, the relative impact of expression factors is hard to estimate on the genome level.},
